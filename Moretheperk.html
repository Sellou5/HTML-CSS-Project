                Charlie is a freshman. And while he's not the biggest geek in the school,
                he is by no means popular. Shy, introspective, intelligent beyond his years yet
                socially awkward, he is a wallflower, caught between trying to live his life and trying to
                run from it. Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world
                of first dates and mixed tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, 
                when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite. But Charlie can't stay on the sideline forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor.
The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a deeply affecting coming-of-age story that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up.
